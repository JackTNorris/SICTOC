<h2>What is it?</h3>
<p>A location-based chat app targeted towards students, designed to allow for "cold-approches" in a global pandemic | Winner of the Fall 2020 UARK ACM Hackathon (meaning I coded it in < 24 hrs, so excuse the bugs)</p>
  <h2>Why Call It "SICTOC"?</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>It's an acronym for what the app's purpose is!</li>
    <li>Phonetically, it sounds like "sick talk", which sums up the app exactly: it's a way for students to talk safely in a time of sickness (I.E COVID)
    <li>It's a bit of a riff on the wildly popular app, TikTok</li>
  </ol>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Chat function to interact with people nearby!</li>
  <li>Customizeable profile (to find similar interests)</li>
  <li>Discovery radius picker</li>
  <li>Non-persistent chats (they disappear like an actual conversation!)</li>
  <li>Login that cross references data with mock student IDs in a database to verify a user is a student!</li>
  <li>^Persistent login so you don't have to login everytime!</li>
</ul>
